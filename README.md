# Personal Portfolio

## Installation and configuration instructions 
- Clone the repository: 1git clone `https://github.com/azariak/portfolio.git`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the project: `npm run dev`
- Input your Gemini API Key in settings
- Configure to yourself by updated the `questionsAndAnswers.json` file and updating the title & favicon in `index.html`

TODO:
- Work with and without API key
- Refact app.jsx into many subdirectories and files
- Make a configuration file of Name, instructions, favicon... so anyone can recycle the code for their own portfolio site. 
- Consider footer modal (lean against)
